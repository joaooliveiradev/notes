## Under Construction ðŸš§

My plan to this repository it's to put my notes from the studies about software engineering, development, product, etc'


## Want contribute?

Well, if you see something wrong in my annotations about a specific topic, you can suggest a better link for me to study and suggest another explanation about it, you can also correct me if you see something wrong, i really appreciate this kind of help xD. 
## Inspiration

Most of the content that i will study is from [TK Researchs](https://github.com/imteekay), i think he made an amazing job gathering so many resources about a lot of topics.

So, thank you [TK](https://github.com/imteekay) for the inspiration and help.
