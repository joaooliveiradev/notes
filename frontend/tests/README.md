## Under Construction ðŸš§

Front End Tests Research

- [React Testing Library](react-testing-library)
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)

For this, i will use a [project](https://github.com/Santosl2/github-finder) this project that i found Github, will be the same project for any of this tools. I will just focus on learn.

Note: Some testes that i will doing here maybe isn't the "best test" because i just want to focus in learning the API, so i will made
some tests that maybe encompass implementation details, etc.
